Repeat the pre-BCB training provided by Makers, by Josue. Set up a cluster and app using terraform first. Once you can do this reliably, move on to using gitlab and pipelines. Also add tests

Have an app
Make a change
Push to gitlab
Run tests and linting
Throw errors if wrong
Build images
Send images to eg dockerhub
Provision cluster with images, built into container
Specify an env
